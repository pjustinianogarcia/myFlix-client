# myFlix-client

## Project Overview

myFlix is a frontend application for the movie database myFlix I built a few weeks ago. It allows users to browse movies, view detailed information about each movie, manage their profile, and maintain a list of their favorite movies. The application is built using React and React Bootstrap, with React Router for client-side routing.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
- **Movie Browsing**: Browse through a collection of movies fetched from the backend API.
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about a specific movie.
- **User Profile**: View and update user profile information.
- **Favorite Movies**: Add or remove movies from a list of favorites.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for movies by title using a search bar in the navigation.

## Dependencies

- React
- React Router
- React Bootstrap
- Bootstrap
- Fetch API for HTTP requests
